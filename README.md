# World Population Visualization Project

This project visualizes world population data on a map using D3.js, TopoJSON, and GeoJSON.

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You will also need `d3`, `topojson`, and `d3-queue` libraries.

```bash
npm install d3 topojson d3-queue

Step 1: Download GeoJSON Data from Natural Earth
Visit Natural Earth Data.
Download the GeoJSON data for the world. The 50m resolution dataset is recommended for a balance between detail and performance.
Save the GeoJSON file as 50m.json in your projectâ€™s src/data/ directory.
Step 2: Convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON
Install the topojson command-line tool if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g topojson
Convert the 50m.json GeoJSON file to TopoJSON to reduce file size and improve performance:
bash
Copy code
topojson -o src/data/50m.topo.json --simplify-proportion 0.5 -- src/data/50m.json
The --simplify-proportion option helps reduce the complexity of the geometry. Adjust the value based on your performance needs.
Step 3: Download Population Data
Visit api.population.io to access population data.
Download or fetch the population data for different countries.
Save the population data as population.json in the src/data/ directory.
